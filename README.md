# PWM-generator-Verilog-


This is a Verilog implementation of a PWM generator. The module takes in a clock signal, a reset signal, and a duty cycle value as inputs, and outputs a pulse width modulated (PWM) signal and a cycle signal.

The duty cycle value determines the percentage of the signal that is high, and is specified as an integer value between 0 and 2^dutywidth, where dutywidth is a parameter that can be set by the user. The output PWM signal is a square wave with a duty cycle corresponding to the input duty cycle value.

The module also includes a cycle signal that can be used to indicate the end of a PWM cycle. The cycle signal is high for one clock cycle at the end of each PWM cycle.

The implementation uses a counter that increments on each clock cycle to generate the PWM signal, with the duty cycle controlled by comparing the counter value to the input duty cycle value.

The code is provided as a Verilog module that can be instantiated in larger designs. The module can be customized by setting the dutywidth parameter to adjust the resolution of the PWM signal.
